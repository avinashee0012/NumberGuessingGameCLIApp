# [COMPLETE] Number Guessing Game CLI App

A simple number guessing command line game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user has to guess it. The user will be given a limited number of chances to guess the number. If the user guesses the number correctly, the game will end, and the user will win. Otherwise, the game will continue until the user runs out of chances.

Project does not use a dependency management tool and hence, is done manually. JAR file includes all dependencies.

Future Releases:
1. Add a timer to see how long it takes the user to guess the number.
2. Implement a hint system that provides clues to the user if they are stuck.
3. Keep track of the userâ€™s high score (i.e., the fewest number of attempts it took to guess the number under a specific difficulty level).
